Good day everyone, today we will delve into the topic of "Modern Approaches in NLP," or Natural Language Processing. This field is a critical area within artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. We will explore various state-of-the-art methodologies currently being employed to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The knowledge we gain can be applied in multiple domains, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational agents, among others. Let's embark on this enlightening journey together.
